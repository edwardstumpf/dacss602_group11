# Introduction
<!--
What is your experiment about (4-5 sentences).
-->
In the recent years, companies have heavily integrated AI into their employee management processes. For some companies, AI performance evaluations are now taken into consideration while handling appraisals and bonuses. While AI promises a sense of certainty and fairness of judgement algorithmically, does it put the workers under a certain amount of pressure to meet the AI standards? Does the employees outlook on their company change based on how AI judges their performance? Our research targets how AI based performance evaluations shape employees’ perceptions of their workplace, and their loyalty to their company. 

# Methodology
<!--
Describe your experiment design, including: (1) experiment design, (2) treatments, (3) outcome variable(s), (4) sample size, and (5) data cleaning procedures (if applicable) [8-10 sentences]
-->
## Research Question 
Does the use of AI in employee performance reviews affect an individual's’ perception of the quality of their work, their work environment, and personal allegiance / loyalty to their company?

## Hypothesis
The use of AI in employee performance reviews plays a big role in employees’ perceptions of the quality of their work, their work environment, and personal allegiance / loyalty to their company.

Employees evaluated by AI view their work through a more critical lens as compared to employees evaluated by their human supervisors.

## Treatments
|                             | Control | Treatment 1 | Treatment 2 | Treatment 3 |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Demographics questions   | Yes     | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         |
| Exposure to traditional human driven performance review process. manager performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | Yes     | No          | No          | No          |
| Exposure to AI augmented performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation; manager reviews data, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | No      | Yes         | No          | No          |
| Exposure to AI augmented performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, and writes review; manager provides feedback to employee | No      | No          | Yes         | No          |
| Exposure to AI driven performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | No      | No          | No          | Yes         |
| Survey questions to measure trust/opinions around the depicted performance reviews | Yes     | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         |

# Analysis

<!--
Which statistical test is used, and why? [3-4 sentences]
-->

<!--
Run the chosen test! To do so: (1) import the libraries you need, (2) import your data, (3) double-check the names of your IV(s) and DV, and (4) run the test. For information on the libraries and R syntax, refer to see Lecture 10.
-->

```{r}
# import libraries
# import data
# test!

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)

# g11q6_1: Do you think the evaluation accurately reflects your performance?
# g11q6_2: Do you have any concerns about biases influencing the evaluation's fairness?
# g11q6_3: Do you trust the evaluation's recommendations regarding your growth at the company?
# g11q7: Artificial Intelligence or AI technology enables computers to complete tasks that humans typically do, such as creating text, images, and making decisions. How much do you feel you know about AI?
# g11q8: If your performance was to be evaluated solely based on AI without any manager intervention, would you trust the report generated by AI?

# g11industry: Which of the following best describes the industry you work in?
# g11role: Which of these best describes your current role?

# the built-in R data set named ToothGrowth:
# data from a study evaluating the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs.
# The experiment has been performed on 60 pigs, where each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). Tooth length was measured and a sample of the data is shown below
my_data = ToothGrowth
str(my_data)

# Convert dose as a factor and recode the levels
# as D0.5, D1, D2
my_data$dose <- factor(my_data$dose,
                       levels = c(0.5, 1, 2),
                       labels = c("D0.5", "D1", "D2"))

# # Another example: Two-way interaction plot
# interaction.plot(x.factor = my_data$dose, trace.factor = my_data$supp, 
#                  # x.factor: the factor to be plotted on x axis
