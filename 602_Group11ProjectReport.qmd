# Introduction
<!--
What is your experiment about (4-5 sentences).
-->
In the recent years, companies have heavily integrated AI into their employee management processes. For some companies, AI performance evaluations are now taken into consideration while handling appraisals and bonuses. While AI promises a sense of certainty and fairness of judgement algorithmically, does it put the workers under a certain amount of pressure to meet the AI standards? Does the employees outlook on their company change based on how AI judges their performance? Our research targets how AI based performance evaluations shape employees’ perceptions of their workplace, and their loyalty to their company. 

# Methodology
<!--
Describe your experiment design, including: (1) experiment design, (2) treatments, (3) outcome variable(s), (4) sample size, and (5) data cleaning procedures (if applicable) [8-10 sentences]
-->
## Research Question 
Does the use of AI in employee performance reviews affect an individual's’ perception of the quality of their work, their work environment, and personal allegiance / loyalty to their company?

## Hypothesis
The use of AI in employee performance reviews plays a big role in employees’ perceptions of the quality of their work, their work environment, and personal allegiance / loyalty to their company.

Employees evaluated by AI view their work through a more critical lens as compared to employees evaluated by their human supervisors.

## Treatments
|                             | Control | Treatment 1 | Treatment 2 | Treatment 3 |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Demographics questions   | Yes     | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         |
| Exposure to traditional human driven performance review process. manager performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | Yes     | No          | No          | No          |
| Exposure to AI augmented performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation; manager reviews data, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | No      | Yes         | No          | No          |
| Exposure to AI augmented performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, and writes review; manager provides feedback to employee | No      | No          | Yes         | No          |
| Exposure to AI driven performance review process. AI performs data collection and curation, generates report on performance, writes review, and provides feedback to employee | No      | No          | No          | Yes         |
| Survey questions to measure trust/opinions around the depicted performance reviews | Yes     | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         |

# Analysis

<!--
Which statistical test is used, and why? [3-4 sentences]
-->

<!--
Run the chosen test! To do so: (1) import the libraries you need, (2) import your data, (3) double-check the names of your IV(s) and DV, and (4) run the test. For information on the libraries and R syntax, refer to see Lecture 10.
-->

```{r}
# import libraries
# import data
# test!

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

experimentData <- read_csv("data/rd_602_fall25_group11.csv")
demographicsCodeBook <- read_csv("data/demographic-codebook-theorem-exchange.csv")

View(experimentData)
View(demographicsCodeBook)

```




# Results
<!--
Report and interpret the test results. For information on what should be included, refer to lecture 10. Also add at least one plot.
-->




# Findings
<!--
Findings: Report the statistic you obtained along with the information to decide whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not. Use a plot and/or table with a proper label.
-->



# Discussion
<!--
What are the implications of the study? What are possible explanations if the results do not align with your hypothesis? Any suggestions for future studies?
-->



# Conclusion
<!--Two or three sentences
-->


### For your information
<!--
Some example code for different plots. Below is only for your information. Submit your report after removing this section.

```{r}
# the built-in R data set named ToothGrowth:
# data from a study evaluating the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs.
# The experiment has been performed on 60 pigs, where each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). Tooth length was measured and a sample of the data is shown below
my_data = ToothGrowth
str(my_data)

# Convert dose as a factor and recode the levels
# as D0.5, D1, D2
my_data$dose <- factor(my_data$dose,
                       levels = c(0.5, 1, 2),
                       labels = c("D0.5", "D1", "D2"))
head(my_data)

# frequency table:
table(my_data$supp, my_data$dose)
```


```{r}
# Line plots with multiple groups
# plot tooth length ("len") by groups ("dose")
# color box plot by a second group: "supp"
# add error bars: mean_se
# library(ggpubr)
# ggline(my_data, x = "dose", y = "len", color = "supp",
#        add = c("mean_se", "dotplot"),
#        palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))
# 
# # OR
# # using R base graphs:
# boxplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = my_data, frame = FALSE,
#         col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"), ylab = "Tooth Length")
# 
# # Another example: Two-way interaction plot
# interaction.plot(x.factor = my_data$dose, trace.factor = my_data$supp, 
#                  # x.factor: the factor to be plotted on x axis
#                  # trace.factor: the factor to be plotted as lines
#                  # response: a numeric variable giving the response
#                  response = my_data$len, fun = mean,
#                  # type: the type of plot (p: point, l: line, b: both point and line)
#                  type = "b", legend = TRUE,
#                  xlab = "Dose", ylab = "Tooth Length",
#                  pch = c(1, 19), col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))
